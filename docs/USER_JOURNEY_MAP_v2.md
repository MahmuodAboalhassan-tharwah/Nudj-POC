## Critical Pain Points to Solve

1. **Evidence Upload (Highest Friction)** — Assessors struggle to find, gather, and upload documents. Need drag-and-drop, mobile upload, example descriptions, and clear checklists.

2. **Progress Tracking** — Client Admins are anxious about team completion. Need real-time dashboards, per-assessor status, and automated reminders.

3. **Team Coordination** — Getting department heads to complete assessments on time. Need auto-reminders, easy delegation, and clear time estimates per domain.

4. **Review Pressure** — Analysts face pressure validating claims against evidence. Need private notes, evidence status indicators, and efficient review workflows.

5. **Onboarding Reluctance** — Assessors see it as "another task." Need seamless registration, time estimates, Arabic walkthrough, and mobile-first design.

## V2 Value Loop

The V2 features create a self-reinforcing engagement cycle:
```
Complete Assessment → See Benchmark vs Peers → Ask AI Coach for Improvements
        ↑                                                          ↓
        └──────── Re-Assess to Track Progress ←── Implement Changes
```

This loop drives:
- **Retention:** Clients return for repeat assessments
- **Upsell:** Coach insights surface consulting opportunities
- **Data moat:** Each assessment enriches the benchmark dataset
- **Market position:** Industry reports establish Tharwah as thought leader
